Please unzip the axislibs.tar.gz in the lib file of you weblogic to get the search service to work correctly.

So for example axislibs.tar.gz should be unzipped to the following directory.
C:\Oracle\Middleware\user_projects\domains\base_domain\lib

If done correctly then there should be a directory in there called axislibs with 100 jar files. This will be used by
the search service calls.

To test this is working once installed. Go to the wallet app and enter mpn,otac etc and when you get to the following
http://YOURHOSTNAME.o2.co.uk:7001/finance/chooseAccount.do 
you should see a list of accounts registered for that msisdn. OBviously you have to use a account that has more than 
one account associated with that msisdn.
